# Bootstrapping Challenge

NJabbari


## Instructions

Use bootstrapping to estimate a confidence interval for a statistic of interest, mean. 

* The two notebooks document the process. In 'two_samples_Ramen-reviews-USA-vs-Japan', the samples are bootstrapped separately, whereas in 'mergedsamples-Ramen-reviews-USA-vs-Japan', samples are merged prior to bootstrapping.
